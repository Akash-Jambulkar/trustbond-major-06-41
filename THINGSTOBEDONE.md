## Technical Implementation Details

### Blockchain Implementation
- Use Ethereum mainnet and test networks (Goerli/Sepolia) for staging
- Implemented smart contracts:
  - KYCVerifier: Document verification and attestation
  - TrustScore: Credit scoring and reputation
  - LoanManager: Loan processing and management

### Integration Architecture
1. **Frontend → Backend → Blockchain Flow**:
   - User submits KYC through frontend
   - Backend validates and stores documents
   - Backend submits hash to blockchain
   - Blockchain events trigger verification processes
   - Verification results stored both on-chain and in database

2. **Bank Verification Flow**:
   - Bank logs in and views pending verifications
   - Bank accesses documents through secure channel
   - Bank approves/rejects documents
   - Verification status updated on blockchain
   - Notifications sent to user
   - Trust score updated

3. **Document Sharing Flow**:
   - Bank selects verified document to share
   - Bank specifies target bank and access parameters
   - System encrypts and grants access with expiry
   - Target bank receives notification
   - Access is recorded on blockchain for audit

4. **Loan Processing Flow**:
   - User submits loan application with purpose and amount
   - System calculates credit score and interest rate
   - Bank reviews application and approves/rejects
   - Loan contract created on blockchain
   - User makes repayments through the platform
   - Repayment history affects trust score

### Security Considerations
- Implement hash verification for document integrity
- Store only document hashes on the blockchain, not actual documents
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database
- Multi-factor authentication for all sensitive operations
- Use secure communication channels for document sharing

## Next Immediate Steps

1. [ ] Create secure key management system
2. [ ] Complete comprehensive test suite
3. [ ] Implement regulatory compliance checking
4. [ ] Set up security audit process
5. [ ] Create disaster recovery procedures

## Long-term Vision
- Expand to a decentralized identity platform
- Create a consortium of verified financial institutions
- Implement cross-border KYC verification
- Develop a tokenized loan marketplace
- Add support for digital identity credentials
