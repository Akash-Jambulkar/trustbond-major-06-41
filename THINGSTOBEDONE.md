## Technical Implementation Details

### Blockchain Implementation
- Use Ganache for local testing
- Deploy to test networks (Goerli/Sepolia) for staging
- Implement the following smart contracts:
  - KYCVerifier: Document verification and attestation
  - TrustScore: Credit scoring and reputation
  - LoanManager: Loan processing and management
  - IdentityRegistry: Identity management and verification

### Database Structure
- Supabase tables:
  - kyc_document_submissions: Track submitted documents
  - trust_score_history: Track user trust scores
  - loan_applications: Track loan applications
  - verification_requests: Track verification requests between banks
  - blockchain_transactions: Track all blockchain transactions

### Integration Architecture
1. **Frontend → Backend → Blockchain Flow**:
   - User submits KYC through frontend
   - Backend validates and stores documents
   - Backend submits hash to blockchain
   - Blockchain events trigger verification processes
   - Verification results stored both on-chain and in database

2. **Bank Verification Flow**:
   - Bank logs in and views pending verifications
   - Bank accesses documents through secure channel
   - Bank approves/rejects documents
   - Verification status updated on blockchain
   - Notifications sent to user
   - Trust score updated

### Security Considerations
- Implement hash verification for document integrity
- Store only document hashes on the blockchain, not actual documents
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database
- Implement proper RLS policies in Supabase
- Use secure communication channels for document sharing

## Next Immediate Steps

1. ✓ Fix existing MetaMask connection issues in Production mode
2. ✓ Build transaction history viewer for blockchain operations
3. ✓ Complete the KYC verification workflow for banks
4. ✓ Implement document uniqueness verification
5. ✓ Set up blockchain event listeners for verification updates
6. ✓ Enhance the user dashboard with real-time status updates
7. ✓ Implement proper error handling across all components
8. ✓ Add document encryption for secure storage

## Next Phase Development
1. Implement consensus mechanism for multi-bank verifications
2. Add bank registration and verification process
3. Complete loan application workflow and scoring algorithms
4. Set up secure document sharing between banks
5. Implement multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
6. Create comprehensive test suite and compliance checks

## Long-term Vision
- Expand to a decentralized identity platform
- Create a consortium of verified financial institutions
- Implement cross-border KYC verification
- Develop a tokenized loan marketplace
- Add support for digital identity credentials

## Additional Enhancements to Consider
- Implement biometric verification methods
