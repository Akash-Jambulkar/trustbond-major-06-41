## Technical Implementation Details

### Blockchain Implementation
- Use Ganache for local testing
- Deploy to test networks (Goerli/Sepolia) for staging
- Implement the following smart contracts:
  - KYCVerifier: Document verification and attestation
  - TrustScore: Credit scoring and reputation
  - LoanManager: Loan processing and management
  - IdentityRegistry: Identity management and verification

### Database Structure
- Supabase tables:
  - kyc_document_submissions: Track submitted documents
  - trust_score_history: Track user trust scores
  - loan_applications: Track loan applications
  - verification_requests: Track verification requests between banks
  - blockchain_transactions: Track all blockchain transactions

### Integration Architecture
1. **Frontend → Backend → Blockchain Flow**:
   - User submits KYC through frontend
   - Backend validates and stores documents
   - Backend submits hash to blockchain
   - Blockchain events trigger verification processes
   - Verification results stored both on-chain and in database

2. **Bank Verification Flow**:
   - Bank logs in and views pending verifications
   - Bank accesses documents through secure channel
   - Bank approves/rejects documents
   - Verification status updated on blockchain
   - Notifications sent to user
   - Trust score updated

### Security Considerations
- Implement hash verification for document integrity
- Store only document hashes on the blockchain, not actual documents
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database
- Implement proper RLS policies in Supabase
- Use secure communication channels for document sharing

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Fix existing MetaMask connection issues in Production mode
2. Complete the KYC verification workflow for banks
3. Implement document uniqueness verification
4. Set up blockchain event listeners for verification updates
5. Enhance the user dashboard with real-time status updates
6. Implement proper error handling across all components

## Long-term Vision
- Expand to a decentralized identity platform
- Create a consortium of verified financial institutions
- Implement cross-border KYC verification
- Develop a tokenized loan marketplace
- Add support for digital identity credentials
