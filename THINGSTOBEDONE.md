## Technical Implementation Details

### Blockchain Implementation
- Use Ganache for local testing
- Deploy to test networks (Goerli/Sepolia) for staging
- Implement the following smart contracts:
  - KYCVerifier: Document verification and attestation
  - TrustScore: Credit scoring and reputation
  - LoanManager: Loan processing and management
  - IdentityRegistry: Identity management and verification

### Database Structure
- Supabase tables:
  - kyc_document_submissions: Track submitted documents
  - trust_score_history: Track user trust scores
  - loan_applications: Track loan applications
  - verification_requests: Track verification requests between banks
  - blockchain_transactions: Track all blockchain transactions
  - bank_registrations: Track bank registration applications
  - document_shares: Track document sharing between banks

### Integration Architecture
1. **Frontend → Backend → Blockchain Flow**:
   - User submits KYC through frontend
   - Backend validates and stores documents
   - Backend submits hash to blockchain
   - Blockchain events trigger verification processes
   - Verification results stored both on-chain and in database

2. **Bank Verification Flow**:
   - Bank logs in and views pending verifications
   - Bank accesses documents through secure channel
   - Bank approves/rejects documents
   - Verification status updated on blockchain
   - Notifications sent to user
   - Trust score updated

3. **Document Sharing Flow**:
   - Bank selects verified document to share
   - Bank specifies target bank and access parameters
   - System encrypts and grants access with expiry
   - Target bank receives notification
   - Access is recorded on blockchain for audit

4. **Loan Processing Flow**:
   - User submits loan application with purpose and amount
   - System calculates credit score and interest rate
   - Bank reviews application and approves/rejects
   - Loan contract created on blockchain
   - User makes repayments through the platform
   - Repayment history affects trust score

### Security Considerations
- Implement hash verification for document integrity
- Store only document hashes on the blockchain, not actual documents
- Encrypt sensitive data in the database
- Implement proper RLS policies in Supabase
- Use secure communication channels for document sharing
