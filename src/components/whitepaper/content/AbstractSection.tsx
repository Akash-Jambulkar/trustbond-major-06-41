        Financial authentication and fairness in allocation of credits are important functionalities for accounting systems. The institutions are required to thoroughly verify the identity of the customer or organizations and their liabilities to prevent laundering. In such cases, banks and other financial institutions depend on processes like KYC to obtain substantial information about the client. It has now become a regulatory condition intended to prevent financial frauds, money laundering, and other illegal activities. Clients or customers are required to furnish the process and accomplish it in the bank itself. Redundantly, in case the customer seeks another bank, the same process is followed for the same client. This is time-consuming and monotonous too and needs to be prevented. To accomplish the same, we propose an optimal solution using blockchain to store validated data of the client and reliably share it across stakeholders upon request. The proposed model in this paper is an implementation of maintaining and sharing relevant information through KYC.
