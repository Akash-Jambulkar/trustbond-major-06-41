        Several research papers are found that focus on blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) technologies to enhance Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. These papers propose secure, efficient, and transparent systems for managing KYC documentation in banking and financial systems. Key features include decentralized data storage, automation using smart contracts, and reduced operational costs.

        A study explores how blockchain and IPFS enable secure KYC verification, ensuring data privacy and seamless sharing among banks while complying with regulations. Another paper discusses a system where KYC data is stored on IPFS and accessible via blockchain, reducing redundancy and enhancing data integrity. These works collectively demonstrate how integrating blockchain and IPFS can address challenges such as high costs, data security, and regulatory compliance in traditional KYC systems.

        The research paper "Secure and Transparent KYC for Banking System Using IPFS and Blockchain Technology" explores a novel approach to improving the Know Your Customer (KYC) process by leveraging blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). It highlights a decentralized and secure framework that stores and manages KYC data, ensuring immutability, transparency, and privacy. The system reduces redundancy by enabling data sharing across organizations while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.
