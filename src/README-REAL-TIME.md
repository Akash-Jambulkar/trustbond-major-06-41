# TrustBond Real-Time Implementation Guide

This document explains how the real-time data flow and monitoring has been implemented in the TrustBond platform.

## Architecture Overview

The TrustBond platform uses a real-time event-driven architecture to provide immediate feedback and updates across all dashboards:

1. **Event Emitter System**: A centralized event emitter that broadcasts blockchain events throughout the application
2. **Supabase Real-Time Subscriptions**: Database-level subscriptions for persistent data changes
3. **Smart Contract Event Listeners**: Direct blockchain event monitoring
4. **Simulated Events**: Development-mode event simulation for testing

## Real-Time Components

### 1. Dashboard Stats (All User Types)

- User Dashboard: Real-time KYC status, trust score, and loan metrics
- Bank Dashboard: Real-time pending verification counts, loan volumes, and trust score distributions
- Admin Dashboard: System status, user counts, and blockchain statistics

### 2. Transaction Visualizer

- Animated visualization of blockchain transactions
- Real-time transaction stream
- Status updates for pending, confirmed, and failed transactions

### 3. Transaction History

- Comprehensive list of all blockchain transactions
- Real-time updates when new transactions occur
- Filtering by transaction type

## Implementation Details

### Event Types

The system supports these real-time event types:

```typescript
export enum RealTimeEventType {
  KYC_UPDATED = 'kyc_updated',
  TRUST_SCORE_UPDATED = 'trust_score_updated',
  LOAN_UPDATED = 'loan_updated',
  TRANSACTION_UPDATED = 'transaction_updated',
  BANK_VERIFICATION_UPDATED = 'bank_verification_updated',
  CONSENSUS_UPDATED = 'consensus_updated'
}
```

### Usage in Components

Components can subscribe to real-time updates using the `useRealTimeUpdates` hook:

```typescript
import { RealTimeEventType, useRealTimeUpdates } from "@/utils/realTimeData";

// Inside your component
useRealTimeUpdates(RealTimeEventType.TRANSACTION_UPDATED, (data) => {
  // Handle the update
  console.log("New transaction:", data);
});
```

### Development Simulation

For development and testing, a simulation system generates realistic blockchain events:

```typescript
// Start simulation with events every 10 seconds
const stopSimulation = startSimulation(10000);

// Stop simulation when finished
stopSimulation();

// Generate a single random event
simulateRandomBlockchainEvent();
```

## Production Implementation

In production, the simulation is replaced by:

1. **Blockchain Listeners**: Direct Web3 event subscriptions
2. **Supabase Subscriptions**: Real-time database change notifications
3. **WebSocket Connections**: For immediate updates across client instances

## Technical Components

1. `realTimeData.ts`: Core event emitter and subscription logic
2. `simulateBlockchainEvents.ts`: Development-mode simulation engine
3. `BlockchainContext.tsx`: Integration into the application context
4. `DashboardStats.tsx`: Real-time metrics visualization
5. `TransactionVisualizer.tsx`: Animated transaction visualization

## Future Enhancements

1. **WebRTC Support**: For direct peer-to-peer updates
2. **Enhanced Analytics**: Real-time statistical analysis
3. **Mobile Push Notifications**: For critical events like KYC verification or loan approvals
4. **Cross-Device Synchronization**: Real-time updates across all user devices

## Testing Real-Time Features

To test the real-time functionality:

1. Connect multiple browser windows to the same account
2. Perform actions in one window and observe updates in the other
3. Check the console logs for simulated events (in development mode)
4. Verify that toast notifications appear for important events
