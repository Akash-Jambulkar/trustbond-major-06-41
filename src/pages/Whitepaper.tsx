                    Financial authentication and fairness in allocation of credits are important functionalities for accounting systems. The institutions are required to thoroughly verify the identity of the customer or organizations and their liabilities to prevent laundering. In such cases, banks and other financial institutions depend on processes like KYC to obtain substantial information about the client. It has now become a regulatory condition intended to prevent financial frauds, money laundering, and other illegal activities. Clients or customers are required to furnish the process and accomplish it in the bank itself. Redundantly, in case the customer seeks another bank, the same process is followed for the same client. This is time-consuming and monotonous too and needs to be prevented. To accomplish the same, we propose an optimal solution using blockchain to store validated data of the client and reliably share it across stakeholders upon request. The proposed model in this paper is an implementation of maintaining and sharing relevant information through KYC.

                    KYC (Know Your client) is a crucial component in combating financial crime and money laundering, with client identification being the most vital factor, as it serves as the initial step for enhancing performance in subsequent stages of the process. The electronic know your customer (e-KYC) is a technique utilized by banks or identity providers to verify consumer identity data across dependent parties. Financial institutions can use off the-shelf e-KYC software that has all the features they need, or they can create their own software from the ground up to deploy the system. They can then choose between an on-premise or cloud-based deployment approach for the system.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    The majority of businesses now store their systems and data on the cloud, thanks to the popularity of outsourcing. Compared to the host-based e-KYC authentication approach, which requires document validation via the centralized host, a cloud-based e-KYC system offers a more efficient and flexible authentication method. Generating a normalized index called as trust scores with machine learning algorithms and blockchain technology and further verifying the electronically generated KYC has proved successful in several findings.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Automation of the process of KYC is one of the crucial aspects in the e-KYC. The automation with smart contracts improves efficiency by reducing operational expenses and minimizing human interventions in the process. This also prevents redundant verification through various sources of financial transaction or institutions. Consequently, the integration through varied services reduces the time and incurs minimal expenditures.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Trust scores, as a final metric for assessment, are transparent and immune to manipulation or tempering of records, due to the inherent characteristics of blockchain, immutability. This ensures trust in the process with enhanced credibility and supports streamlined decision-making. This is accomplished by providing real-time access to trust profiles.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    The goal of the blockchain-based KYC Verification and Trust Score Generation project is to provide a safe and effective system that enables banks to calculate trust scores for loan applications, store customer KYC data on the blockchain, and validate customer data. This project for KYC automation aims at improving the security and accuracy of procedures client verification while optimizing cross-bank interactions by using the immutability and security of blockchain technology in conjunction with machine learning for real-time risk assessment.

                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>High Operational Costs:</strong> KYC processes require substantial resources, including staff, technology, and infrastructure, leading to increased costs for financial institutions.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Inefficiency and Redundancy:</strong> Customers often need to repeat KYC verification with multiple organizations, causing delays and frustration. Institutions face redundancy in verifying the same information repeatedly.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Data Security and Privacy Risks:</strong> Centralized storage of sensitive customer data increases the risk of breaches, hacking, and identity theft. Ensuring compliance with global privacy regulations, such as GDPR, adds complexity.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Limited Interoperability:</strong> Lack of standardization across institutions and jurisdictions makes it difficult to share verified KYC data securely. Fragmented systems hinder global collaboration and efficiency.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Evolving Fraud Tactics:</strong> Fraudsters continuously develop new methods to bypass KYC checks, making it challenging for institutions to stay ahead. Synthetic identities and document forgery are persistent issues.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-trustbond-dark mb-2">B. Smart Contracts</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Smart contracts are self-executing programs stored on a blockchain that automatically enforce, verify, or execute terms of an agreement without the need for intermediaries. They operate based on predefined rules coded into them, and once conditions are met, the contract triggers the agreed-upon actions. Key features of smart contracts include:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Automation:</strong> Smart contracts eliminate the need for manual intervention by executing tasks automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Immutability:</strong> Once deployed on the blockchain, smart contracts cannot be altered, ensuring trust and transparency.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Decentralization:</strong> Smart contracts operate on decentralized blockchain networks, removing reliance on centralized authorities.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Security:</strong> Blockchain encryption ensures the integrity and safety of the contract's code and execution.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    For example, in KYC verification, a smart contract could automatically grant access to a customer's verified data to a financial institution upon approval, streamlining the process and reducing fraud. A customer completes KYC verification at one bank. The verified data is stored in an encrypted format on IPFS, and a smart contract logs the verification status. When another bank needs the same KYC data, the customer grants access through the smart contract, eliminating the need to repeat the process.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Several research papers are found that focus on blockchain and InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) technologies to enhance Know Your Customer (KYC) processes. These papers propose secure, efficient, and transparent systems for managing KYC documentation in banking and financial systems. Key features include decentralized data storage, automation using smart contracts, and reduced operational costs.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    A study explores how blockchain and IPFS enable secure KYC verification, ensuring data privacy and seamless sharing among banks while complying with regulations. Another paper discusses a system where KYC data is stored on IPFS and accessible via blockchain, reducing redundancy and enhancing data integrity. These works collectively demonstrate how integrating blockchain and IPFS can address challenges such as high costs, data security, and regulatory compliance in traditional KYC systems.

                  <p>
                    The research paper "Secure and Transparent KYC for Banking System Using IPFS and Blockchain Technology" explores a novel approach to improving the Know Your Customer (KYC) process by leveraging blockchain and the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS). It highlights a decentralized and secure framework that stores and manages KYC data, ensuring immutability, transparency, and privacy. The system reduces redundancy by enabling data sharing across organizations while maintaining compliance with regulatory standards.

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-trustbond-dark mb-2">A. Addressing the Limitations of Traditional KYC Systems</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Traditional KYC verification processes are fragmented, time-consuming, and susceptible to errors and data breaches. Our proposed blockchain-powered KYC verification system addresses these challenges as follows:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Decentralized and Tamper-Proof Storage:</strong> KYC data is securely stored on a blockchain network, ensuring immutability and protection against fraud or unauthorized modifications.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Cross-Bank Verification:</strong> Instead of redundant KYC checks across multiple banks, a shared blockchain ledger enables real-time access to verified customer data, reducing verification costs and processing times.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Privacy and Security:</strong> Customer data is encrypted and access is controlled through smart contracts, ensuring only authorized institutions can access relevant KYC details.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Real-Time Updates:</strong> Any changes to customer data (e.g., address updates) are instantly reflected across all participating banks, reducing the risk of outdated records.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-trustbond-dark mb-2">B. Enhancing Credit Evaluation with Blockchain-Based Trust Scores</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Traditional credit scoring models, such as CIBIL, suffer from inaccuracy, delayed updates, and lack of transparency. The proposed Trust Score Generation System integrates blockchain with machine learning to provide a more reliable and dynamic risk assessment:
                  </p>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Real-Time Data Integration:</strong> Unlike CIBIL, which relies on periodic updates, our system pulls financial behavior data in real time, ensuring up-to-date trust scores.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Incorporation of Alternative Data Sources:</strong> The trust score considers rental payments, utility bills, savings patterns, and digital transactions, providing a holistic financial assessment.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Transparency and Fair Evaluation:</strong> Machine learning algorithms analyze customer financial patterns objectively, reducing bias in loan approval decisions.
                    </li>
                    <li className="mb-2">
                      <strong>Fraud Prevention:</strong> Since all credit-related transactions are recorded on the blockchain, fraudulent activities such as identity theft and loan stacking are easier to detect and prevent.
                    </li>
                  </ul>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-trustbond-dark mb-2">C. Benefits to Financial Institutions and Users</h3>
                  <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
